# Argparse
A simple command line argument parser for Zig. Wanted to experiment with Zig's comptime features to achieve type safety and ease of use.

## Usage
`main.zig` has a simple example of how to use the library. You can run it with `zig build run -- -i hello`, it will echo whatever you pass after the `-i` flag.
